# Abstract
A windscreen wiper is a device used to remove rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, water from a vehicle's front window. Almost all motor vehicles, including cars, trucks, buses, train locomotives, and watercraft with a cabin—and some aircraft—are equipped with one or more such wipers, which are usually a legal requirement. The prior system required manual wiper activation,by changing the frequency it results in the operation of bringing up the wiper speed is varied .The objectives of this project are to upgrade the older cars system by providing automatic wiping system, to improve the system by using sensor with actuator and to design a basic program that will fully operate with the system. The concept of this proposed wiper system is similar with other existing conventional wiper. In spite of removing water from windscreen, this system also will be upgraded to an automatic control system by using a Peripheral Interface Controller.
