 # Adding LED Blinking
As shown above in the while(1) add the code and the two lines code is shown below.

* HALL_GPIO_TogglePin(GPIOC,GPIO_PIN_13);
* HAL_Delay(1000);

Next press F7 to build the code and once it is built you press F8 to load the code so in the output you can find the commands that programming is done.
Now the LED blinks as per the delay given.
By this programming the STM32 using Keil is successfully done.
